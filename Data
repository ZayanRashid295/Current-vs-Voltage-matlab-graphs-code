This MATLAB code calculates and plots the voltage vs. current curves for three different electrode materials (stainless steel, titanium paper, and nickel foam) in an alkaline electrolyzer. Here's an explanation of the code:

Electrode area and thickness: The code defines the electrode areas (A_ss, A_ti, A_nf) in cm^2 and the electrode thicknesses (t_ss, t_ti, t_nf) in cm for each electrode material.

Electrolyte properties: The code specifies the concentration of KOH (KOH_conc) in wt.% and the density of KOH electrolyte (rho_KOH) in g/cm^3.

Electrode properties: The code provides the densities of the electrode materials (rho_ss, rho_ti, rho_nf) in g/cm^3.

Current density range: The code defines the minimum (j_min) and maximum (j_max) current densities in A/cm^2 and the step size (delta_j) for generating a range of current densities (j).

Voltage calculation: Using the current densities, the code calculates the voltage (V_ss, V_ti, V_nf) for each electrode material using specific equations based on the current densities. These equations use coefficients (eta_ss, eta_ti, eta_nf) specific to each electrode material.

Plotting: The code plots the voltage vs. current curves for each electrode material using the plot function. The curves are represented by red (V_ss), blue (V_ti), and green (V_nf) lines. The x-axis represents the current values multiplied by the electrode area, which gives the actual current in Amperes. The plot includes axis labels, a legend, and a title.

Grid: The code adds a grid to the plot using the grid on statement.

The resulting plot shows the relationship between voltage and current for each electrode material in an alkaline electrolyzer
